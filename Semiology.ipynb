    "#### 1 According to the book, how information is defined?\n",
    "It is a series of correspondences observed within a finite set of variational concepts of components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2 When a component is ordered?\n",
    "When its categories are ordered in a single and universal manner, and when its categories are defined as equidistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3 When a component is quantitative?\n",
    "When its object is to specify the variation in distance among the categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4 How does efficiency is described according to its preposition?\n",
    "If, in order to obtain a correct and complete answerto a given question,all other things being equal, one construction requires a shorter period of perception than another construction, we can Say thatit is more efficient for this question.\n",

    "#### 5 Mention the three levels of organization of a component?\n",
    "Qualitative, ordered, or quantitative. \n",

    "#### 1 When is used ordered perception?\n",
    "It is used when we are comparing two or several orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2 When is used quantitative perception?\n",
    "It is used when we are seekking to define numerically the ratio between two signs. Also when we seek to group homogeneous signs.\n",

    "#### 3 Mention the 4 leves of a variable\n",
    "Selective, associative, ordered, and quantitative. \n",

    "#### 4 What is a point? \n",
    "It is a location on the plane that has no theoretical length or area.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5 What signifies area according to the book?\n",
    "It is something on the plane that has a measurable size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6 What does the frame of a graphic delimits of?\n",
    "It delimits the signifying space, but it does not necessarily delimit the phenomenon."
